                    alt="Pineapple" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;"> Children are growing and
                developing at a fast rate meaning that they require more nutrition for their weight than adults do.
                Nutrients such as omega 3 DHA fats are required to support brain and visual development. DHA contributes
                to normal visual development of infants up to 12 months of age*. Children are also exposed to a lot of
                bacteria and virus at play groups and schools simply due to the number of children they come into
                contact with and children‚Äôs typical poor hygiene awareness. Their immune systems are not fully matured
                and often needs extra support. Topping up with a multivitamin that contains vitamin C is important as it
                is needed to help support their immune system.</p>
            <p>As well as the immune system, vitamin A is needed for skin. Vitamin D is probably the most talked about
                vitamin and is needed for the normal growth of bones, as well as the immune system. Vitamin E is also a
                good nutrient to add as it helps to protect against oxidative stress in the body. You can see from this
                small selection that nutrients are incredibly important for children‚Äôs health. If you are worried about
                whether your child is getting enough nutrients through their diet, you may want to consider a children‚Äôs
                multivitamin which contains these nutrients.</p>

<!-- <div id="myDIV">Parents often worry about their children's height. How tall will they be? Though height has usually been genetically determined, there are a few things parents can do to ensure their child grows and develops normally. 

    Make sure your child is getting enough sleep. How much sleep a child needs depends on age, but 10 to 12 hours per night is a good goal. 
    Make sure your child is eating a well-balanced, healthy diet. 
    Encourage your child to be active. Obesity is a real danger for many kids, so encourage your kids to get plenty of exercise.</div>
