        <h2>Why a Daily Program?</h2>
        <p id="text">Do you want your child to eat a nutritious meal today? As it happens, parents make a lot of
            decisions before that one meal gets on the table tonight. Any one of those decisions can sabotage the
            hoped-for outcome. At the same time, feeding your kids in a healthy way is only one of your objectives among
            the many you have in running busy lives. Do you also want not only that tonight‚Äôs dinner is eaten, but that
            your child develops healthy eating habits for life? Raising a healthy eater is complicated. Studies show
            that when it comes to behavior, people learn best by taking tiny doable practical steps. The program
            sequences the small doable practical changes daily, and that adds up to a big result at the end. When you
            start the program, you will have an opportunity to assess how you make the decisions related to feeding.

                        <p class="c1"> best choices include fresh or tinned fruit. Dried fruit is sticky and high in
                            sugar, <br><br>so have it occasionally. The best left out of the lunch box are dried fruit
                            bars and ‚Äòstraps, which are very high in sugar, low in fiber, and stick to children‚Äôs
                            teeth.<br><br> Try vegetable sticks with dip or a small container with mixed vegetables such
                            as cherry tomatoes.</p>
